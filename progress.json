    "summary": "Based on the article from Neowin, here is a concise summary:\n\nMicrosoft has reportedly discontinued the official method for activating Windows 10 and Windows 11 without an internet connection. The company has quietly removed the \"Get Help\" app's activation troubleshooter, which was the last supported channel for using a product key over the telephone to activate Windows offline.\n\nThis change leaves users with only two official activation options: an automatic online activation during installation or using the online activation troubleshooter within the Settings app, both of which require an active internet connection. The removal primarily impacts users in environments with strict security, no internet access, or unreliable connectivity, such as certain government, military, or specialized industrial systems.\n\nWhile third-party workarounds or volume licensing keys may still function for offline activation, Microsoft's move signifies the end of an easily accessible, consumer-focused offline method. The company has not provided an official statement or reason for removing this feature, but it aligns with its broader push to integrate services and authentication with its online Microsoft Account ecosystem.

The core idea is to treat long prompts as an external environment that the LLM can programmatically navigate: the model can examine, decompose, and recursively call itself on smaller snippets of the input.\n\nThe authors frame this as an **inference-time scaling** approach, contrasting with methods that require architectural changes or extensive retraining. RLMs allow a base LLM to handle inputs up to **two orders of magnitude longer** than its standard context limit.\n\nKey findings from the evaluation across four diverse long-context tasks show that RLMs:\n1.  **Significantly outperform** both the base LLMs and common long-context scaffolding techniques in output quality, even for shorter prompts within the original context window.\n2.  Achieve this with a **comparable or lower cost per query**, making the approach efficient.\n\nIn essence, RLMs provide a general and cost-effective framework for extending the effective context length of existing LLMs through a self-recursive, algorithmic prompting strategy, unlocking their ability to reason over arbitrarily long documents without model modification.",

    "summary": "This article investigates the true tempo of Daft Punk's \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger,\" arguing it is an intentional Easter egg. While most sources list the BPM as 123, the author, a developer of tempo-detection software, asserts the precise tempo is **123.45**.\n\nUsing manual calculation—measuring the exact duration between the first and last clear beats and counting the intervals—the author found the tempo to be 123.4499 on the original CD and 123.4534 on the official YouTube audio, both rounding to 123.45.\n\nThe article then explores whether this specific fractional tempo was intentional. Research into Daft Punk's equipment around the year 2000 reveals that while their Akai MPC-3000 and E-mu SP-1200 sequencers only supported one decimal place, Emagic's Logic Audio software (which they also used) supported four. This makes it technically possible for the precise 123.45 BPM to have been deliberately set.\n\nThe author concludes that the remarkable precision, especially on the original master, strongly suggests this was a hidden joke by Daft Punk, an Easter egg that remained unnoticed for over two decades.",

The author, who has developed profilers, initially dismissed this method but now endorses it for its simplicity and low barrier to entry.\n\nThe key advantages of \"Ctrl-C profiling\" are its ease of use—it requires no special builds, works on almost any system, and avoids the complexity and potential misinterpretation of traditional profiler output. The author provides real-world examples where this method quickly identified issues like slow JSON parsing in a debug build and a gdb slowdown caused by a linker flag incompatibility.\n\nHowever, the article clarifies that this technique is essentially a low-frequency sampling profiler with significant limitations. It is ineffective for detecting small, widespread performance regressions, tail latency issues, or problems in complex multi-threaded/distributed systems. For these \"hard\" problems, more sophisticated tools like simulation-based or tracing profilers are necessary.\n\nUltimately, the author's endorsement is pragmatic: while not a replacement for all profilers, Ctrl-C profiling is a valuable, low-cost first step that often yields quick wins before resorting to more complex tools.",

    "summary": "This article examines why IPv6, which turned 30 in 2025, has not fully replaced IPv4 despite its vastly larger address space. While created to solve IPv4 address exhaustion, its adoption remains below 50% globally.\n\nKey reasons for the slow uptake include a lack of compelling new features, as many planned improvements were later added to IPv4. The development of Network Address Translation (NAT) extended the life of IPv4 by allowing many devices to share a single address, reducing the urgency to switch. Furthermore, IPv6 is not backward-compatible, making migration complex and costly with a low short-term return on investment.\n\nHowever, experts argue IPv6 is not a failure. It succeeded in absorbing growth in mobile, broadband, and cloud environments, preventing the internet from breaking. Its vast address space enables simpler network planning and supports innovation in areas like IoT. Organizations are now advised to plan for IPv6 migration as IPv4 space depletes.\n\nSome, like APNIC's Geoff Huston, suggest IPv6 is becoming less central as new architectures (like QUIC) and a name-based security model (using DNS) reduce reliance on permanent IP addresses. Ultimately, adoption is now often driven by cost—when obtaining more IPv4 addresses is too expensive—rather than technical superiority. Major deployments by companies like Starlink continue to push global adoption forward.",

    "summary": "This talk details the successful attacks discovered during the Raspberry Pi RP2350 Hacking Challenge, which aimed to break the chip's secure boot. The RP2350 is a microcontroller with built-in countermeasures against fault injection (like glitch detectors), but researchers found five distinct vulnerabilities.\n\nThe presentation focuses on two key attacks in particular. The first uses fault injection to force an \"unverified vector boot,\" completely bypassing the secure boot process. The second, a \"double glitch\" technique, allows direct readout of sensitive secrets from the chip's one-time programmable memory.\n\nThe talk highlights the value of security through transparency, praising Raspberry Pi for running an open bug bounty program, being transparent about the findings, and collaborating with researchers to implement mitigations in a new chip revision. It concludes that while the RP2350 had strong security on paper, real-world testing revealed practical weaknesses, offering valuable insights for chip designers and security researchers alike.",

The author first analyzes the hardware, noting the ESP32-S3 controller and the display's slow refresh rate (20-30 seconds), which makes it suitable for static applications like dashboards or digital art.\n\nThe core challenge addressed is the display's limitation to six native colors (white, black, yellow, red, green, blue). To simulate intermediate shades, the author experiments with various dithering patterns, which create pixel arrangements that trick the eye into perceiving new colors. After testing multiple methods, the simple 50% checkerboard pattern proved most effective for drawing clean UI elements, while more complex algorithms like Bayer or Error Diffusion were better for gradients but introduced artifacts.\n\nUsing this dithering approach, the author successfully simulated additional colors like orange, purple, brown, cyan, and light pink by blending the native hues. Practical tests drawing shapes confirmed the effectiveness of these simulated colors. The article concludes that the kit is a versatile platform for ePaper experimentation, emphasizing the importance of understanding color behavior and refresh limitations to create visually appealing projects.

    "summary": "This article describes a simple, two-component circuit that acts as a basic detector for 2.4 GHz radio signals, such as those from Wi-Fi routers, Bluetooth devices, and microwave ovens. Inspired by classic crystal radios, it uses just a high-speed 1N5711 Schottky diode and a red LED to convert invisible RF energy into visible flashes of light.\n\nTo build it, you twist the diode's legs around the legs of the LED, ensuring the diode's cathode (marked with a ring) connects to the LED's anode (the longer leg). The LED's legs also function as a simple dipole antenna. When held near an active 2.4 GHz source, the diode rectifies the RF signal, allowing charge to build up and briefly light the LED in sync with data bursts.\n\nThe article emphasizes that component selection and orientation are critical: the 1N5711 diode is required for its speed, a red LED is needed for its low forward voltage, and the parts must be connected correctly. For best results, avoid touching the antenna legs and try rotating the detector to align with the signal's polarization. The circuit is presented as an effective, solder-free educational tool for demonstrating RF rectification and envelope detection at microwave frequencies.",

    "summary": "The article explains the Linux kernel security team's reactive process for handling reported security bugs. The team, composed of volunteer kernel developers, operates independently of any company and does not make public announcements. To report an issue, individuals must send a plain-text email to a dedicated alias; the team does not assign CVEs.\n\nUpon receiving a report, the team triages the issue, often involving relevant subsystem maintainers to develop a fix. The policy is to resolve bugs quickly, with fixes merged into the mainline and stable kernel branches as soon as possible. The team generally avoids embargoes longer than seven days, believing that a known bug should be fixed promptly.\n\nA core philosophy, articulated by Linus Torvalds, is that all bug fixes are important and should not be specially marked as \"security\" fixes, as this could misleadingly imply other fixes are less critical. The team argues that whether a bug is a security vulnerability depends entirely on a user's specific deployment, which developers cannot know.\n\nThe article notes an exception for hardware-related security issues (like Spectre), which follow a separate, encrypted-email process with longer embargoes.

Smell is our most ancient sense, deeply linked to emotion and memory, yet difficult to study due to its complexity and our limited vocabulary for scents.\n\nScientists are now making progress by breaking smell down into its fundamental elements. On one end, researchers are creating databases that map individual odor molecules to human perceptions, revealing that smell is highly subjective and influenced by personal experience and culture. On the other end, neuroscientists are studying how the brain processes smells. Recent high-resolution recordings from human patients show that scent signals bypass typical sensory relay stations and travel directly to emotional and memory centers like the amygdala and hippocampus, explaining why smells can trigger powerful, immediate, and often subconscious reactions.\n\nTogether, these efforts are providing a richer, more systematic understanding of olfaction, revealing it as a sophisticated and profoundly personal guide to our inner world.",

    "chinese_summary": "**摘要：**\n\nJank 是一种处于 alpha 阶段的编程语言，融合了 Clojure 的设计理念与原生 C++ 的性能。它是基于 LLVM 构建的 Clojure 方言，旨在高度兼容 Clojure 的交互式、函数式及不可变数据导向风格。然而，与在 JVM 上运行并依赖 Java 互操作不同，jank 通过 LLVM 编译，并实现了与 C++ 的无缝互操作性。\n\n该语言包含了 Clojure 的核心特性，如持久化数据结构和函数式编程模式，但支持原生执行。提供的代码示例展示了其类 Clojure 语法、不可变操作以及直接的 C++ 互操作——例如调用 C++ 标准库的线程函数。\n\n该项目目前正在寻求赞助，并已在 Clojure 社区活动中亮相。相关文档可在《jank 手册》中查阅。"

    "title": "A Basic Just-In-Time Compiler (2015)",
    "url": "https://nullprogram.com/blog/2015/03/19/",
    "summary": "This article explains how to build a basic Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for x86-64. The author's motivation was a programming challenge to compute recurrence relations (e.g., u(n+1) = f(u(n))). Instead of interpreting the operations, the JIT compiler translates them directly into machine code for faster execution.\n\nThe core challenge is allocating memory that can be both written (to store generated code) and later executed. The article details using system calls like `mmap` (or `VirtualAlloc` on Windows) to allocate memory, and `mprotect` (or `VirtualProtect`) to change its permissions from writable to executable, adhering to security principles like W^X (Write XOR Execute).\n\nThe compiler supports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /). It generates function code that follows the System V AMD64 calling convention (first argument in `rdi`, return value in `rax`). The author demonstrates how to find the correct machine code bytes for instructions like `mov`, `add`, and `ret` using an assembler and disassembler.\n\nFinally, the generated code in the executable buffer is cast to a function pointer and called directly from C. The article concludes by noting this is a simplified case (no branching or complex features) and expresses interest in building a more advanced JIT compiler in the future.",
    "chinese_title": "一个基本的即时编译器（2015年）",
    "chinese_summary": "本文介绍了如何为x86-64架构构建一个基础的即时（JIT）编译器。作者的初衷源于一个编程挑战：计算递推关系（例如u(n+1) = f(u(n))）。与解释执行操作不同，JIT编译器将其直接转换为机器码以提升运行速度。\n\n核心挑战在于分配既可写入（用于存储生成的代码）又可后续执行的内存。文章详细说明了如何使用系统调用（如Linux的`mmap`或Windows的`VirtualAlloc`）分配内存，并通过`mprotect`（或`VirtualProtect`）将其权限从可写改为可执行，同时遵循W^X（写与执行互斥）等安全原则。\n\n该编译器支持基础算术运算（+、-、*、/），生成的函数代码遵循System V AMD64调用约定（首个参数存于`rdi`，返回值存于`rax`）。作者演示了如何通过汇编器和反汇编器查找`mov`、`add`、`ret`等指令对应的正确机器码字节。\n\n最后，可执行缓冲区中的生成代码被转换为函数指针，并直接从C语言调用。文章结尾指出这是一个简化案例（不含分支或复杂功能），并表达了未来构建更高级JIT编译器的兴趣。"

    "title": "Hacking VBA to support native scripting runtime with no COM dependencies",
    "url": "https://github.com/ECP-Solutions/ASF",
    "summary": "The Advanced Scripting Framework (ASF) is a pure-VBA library that adds modern scripting capabilities to classic VBA projects without requiring external COM dependencies. It functions as an embeddable compiler and virtual machine, enabling developers to write scripts with features like first-class functions, closures, array/object literals, and method chaining directly within Office applications.\n\nKey features include a full expression language with control flow (if/else, loops, try/catch), built-in helpers (map, filter, reduce), string manipulation with regex support, and seamless interoperability with existing VBA code via a passthrough syntax (`@(...)`). The framework also introduces `for-in`/`for-of` loops and a `typeof` operator.\n\nASF is designed for easy adoption: developers import a set of class modules, compile scripts into an inspectable AST, and run them with a simple wrapper class. It includes a comprehensive test suite and is production-ready, allowing complex logic to be implemented concisely while safely leveraging legacy VBA functions.",

    "title": "Accounting for Computer Scientists (2011)",
    "url": "https://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/07/accounting-for-computer-scientists.html",
    "summary": "This article explains basic accounting concepts using graph theory, making them accessible to computer scientists. It frames accounts as nodes and financial transactions as edges in a graph, where money flows along the arrows. Each account's balance is calculated by summing incoming and subtracting outgoing transactions, ensuring all balances collectively sum to zero—the core principle of \"balancing the books.\"\n\nThe author demonstrates how to model real-world events, like sales, expenses, and investments, by adding nodes and edges. This graph can then be used to generate two key financial statements. The **Profit and Loss (P&L) statement** summarizes revenue and expenses over a period, showing profitability (which is distinct from cash flow). The **Balance Sheet** is a snapshot of the company's financial position at a point in time, partitioning the graph into Assets (what the company owns/is owed) and Liabilities & Equity (what it owes/its net worth), with the two sides always balancing.\n\nThe core insight is that accounting is fundamentally about tracking the flow of value through a directed graph. This perspective demystifies jargon and provides a logical foundation for understanding financial statements, which are simply different views or aggregations of the underlying transaction graph.",

    "chinese_summary": "本文运用图论阐释基础会计概念，使计算机科学家能够轻松理解。文章将账户视为节点，财务交易视为图中的边，资金沿箭头方向流动。每个账户的余额通过汇总流入交易并减去流出交易计算，确保所有余额总和为零——这正是“账目平衡”的核心原则。\n\n作者演示了如何通过添加节点和边来模拟销售、支出、投资等现实经济活动。该图随后可用于生成两大关键财务报表：**利润表**汇总特定期间内的收入与支出，反映盈利能力（不同于现金流）；**资产负债表**则是公司在特定时点的财务状况快照，将图划分为资产（公司拥有/被欠的部分）与负债及权益（公司欠款/净资产），两侧始终保持平衡。\n\n核心洞见在于：会计本质上是通过有向图追踪价值流动的过程。这一视角消除了专业术语的神秘感，为理解财务报表提供了逻辑基础——财务报表本质上只是底层交易图的不同视角或聚合呈现。"
