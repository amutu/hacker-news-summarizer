    "summary": "In 2016, an analysis of historical documents revealed that the sugar industry deliberately shaped early heart disease research in the 1960s. Faced with emerging science linking sugar to high cholesterol and triglycerides, a sugar trade group funded a literature review by Harvard researchers. Published in the *New England Journal of Medicine* in 1967, this influential review concluded that reducing dietary cholesterol and saturated fat—not sugar—was the key to preventing coronary heart disease.\n\nThe internal documents showed the sugar industry set the review's objective, supplied articles, and paid the equivalent of $50,000, but this funding and involvement were not disclosed. The review selectively criticized studies on sugar while downplaying limitations of studies on fat, focusing the scientific and public debate on saturated fat as the primary dietary culprit for decades.\n\nThe authors of the 2016 analysis argue this historical manipulation underscores the critical need for transparent funding and conflict-of-interest disclosures in nutrition science. They note that contemporary evidence now strongly links added sugars to hypertension and cardiovascular disease, but health policies have been slow to reflect this shift, having been influenced by the earlier industry-driven narrative.",

This move was met with immediate and widespread backlash from the developer community, who argued it would impose unexpected costs on many projects and open-source initiatives.\n\nIn response to this pushback, GitHub **postponed the implementation of the new billing for self-hosted runners**. However, it proceeded with its other planned change on January 1: **price cuts for its hosted runners**.

Using the Pythagorean theorem and the conversion of 1 inch = 2.54 cm, they confirm the monitor is approximately 27 inches, matching a prior claim.

A key realization is that the underlying problem is often not tab management itself, but task management and the fear of losing important information.\n\nThe conclusion or \"path to sanity\" emphasizes a mindset shift: recognizing that an open tab is not a to-do item. The solution combines adopting a reliable external system (like a task manager or note-taking app) to capture intentions, and then confidently closing tabs.

    "summary": "This article explores meditation as \"wakeful relaxation,\" a state combining alertness with deep physical ease. The author describes the challenge of achieving this, noting that intentional relaxation often triggers anxiety, as muscle tension seems to guard against stress.\n\nThe core idea is drawn from Michael Edward Johnson's theory of \"vasocomputation,\" which posits that patterns of muscle tension—especially in the smooth muscle lining blood vessels—stabilize specific mental states or \"stances.\" These vascular \"latches\" can become semi-permanent, low-energy holds that shape our conscious experience and may contribute to chronic suffering.\n\nWhile the author is skeptical about latches persisting for years without energy, the experiential link between tension and mental patterns feels valid. The article suggests that to truly relax, one must address this smooth muscle system, which is not under direct conscious control. Proposed methods include practices like sauna/cold plunges to force clench-release cycles and ultra-slow body-scan meditation to indirectly influence vascular tension through focused attention.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to unclench these deep, stabilizing tensions to foster a less reactive, more fluid default stance toward reality.",

This allows for consistent, SQL-like operations (e.g., `where size > 10kb`) across different data sources (files, system commands) without parsing text or memorizing flags.\n\nThe author emphasizes Nushell's design as a full-fledged, user-friendly programming language with modern features: clean syntax, type checking, helpful error messages, and IDE support.

    "summary": "Based on the article, here is a concise summary:\n\nAfter a period of perceived lagging behind OpenAI, Google has aggressively restructured and refocused its AI efforts to regain its competitive edge. The key shift was consolidating its disparate AI research teams (Brain and DeepMind) into a single unit called Google DeepMind, led by DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis. This move eliminated internal rivalry and streamlined decision-making.\n\nThe new unit's first major product was Gemini, a powerful multimodal AI model designed to compete directly with OpenAI's GPT-4. Google's strategy leverages its core strengths: massive proprietary datasets from Search and YouTube, vast cloud computing infrastructure, and deep integration across its consumer products (like Android, Gmail, and Maps). This allows Gemini to be more seamlessly embedded into tools used by billions.\n\nWhile OpenAI and Microsoft have a partnership, Google benefits from vertical integration—controlling the full stack from chips (TPUs) to models to user-facing applications. The article notes that Google's pace of innovation has accelerated, moving from a \"cautious, academic\" culture to a more product-focused \"wartime\" mentality. However, it still faces challenges, including the high cost of AI development and the need to balance innovation with its profitable core search business.

    "summary": "This article argues that while libraries are crucial for programmer productivity, they are fundamentally shaped and enabled by the programming languages they are written in. The author responds to a common viewpoint that language design is less important than library creation by explaining that powerful libraries like Ruby on Rails are only possible because of specific language features (e.g., metaprogramming, first-class functions, dynamic typing).\n\nThe core thesis is that a general-purpose language's primary purpose is to enable the creation of powerful, easy-to-use libraries. The language's design directly determines what kinds of libraries can be built and how elegantly they can be used. For example, the lack of certain features in Java or C makes it impossible to port Rails directly, leading to more verbose library designs.\n\nThe author, a language designer, shares a personal example: the difficulty of creating an intuitive game library in Java led to the design of Stanza. This illustrates how new languages often emerge from the inability to express certain abstractions as libraries within existing ones. Ultimately, languages are differentiated by the features they provide that *cannot* be implemented as libraries (e.g., a type system, concurrency model). The ideal, expressive language would allow programmers to build their own object or type systems as libraries, a key direction for programming language research.",

The banned portion is the speech by Aristophanes, which presents a myth about humans originally being spherical beings with multiple limbs and faces who were split in two by the gods; the story explains love as the search for one's missing \"other half,\" encompassing same-sex and opposite-sex pairings.\n\nThe complaint, filed through the university’s \"Bias Education and Support Team,\" alleged that the text promotes \"homosexual relationships\" and \"pederasty\" (ancient Greek mentor-pupil relationships), and was therefore offensive. University administrators agreed, stating the text violated the school’s guidelines against \"harassing conduct\" based on sexual orientation. As a result, the excerpt is no longer included in the required reading for the \"Introduction to World Literature\" course.\n\nThe decision has sparked significant criticism from faculty and scholars. Opponents argue that studying a foundational historical text for its philosophical ideas is not an endorsement of ancient social practices. They contend that removing it is an act of censorship, misapplies bias protocols designed for interpersonal conduct, and deprives students of engaging with a classic work that explores the nature of love.

    "summary": "**Summary of \"Sergey Brin's Unretirement\"**\n\nThe article discusses Google co-founder Sergey Brin's return to an active role at the company, framing his \"unretirement\" as a broader lesson about modern work and retirement.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n*   **Brin's Return:** After stepping back from day-to-day operations in 2019, Sergey Brin has been regularly coming to Google's offices, often multiple days a week. His focus is reportedly on the company's ambitious AI project, Gemini.\n*   **A New Model for \"Retirement\":** The author argues that Brin's move exemplifies a shift away from the traditional concept of a hard stop to one's career. Instead, it represents a more fluid, engaged, and interest-driven phase where individuals leverage their expertise on projects they find meaningful.\n*   **Broader Trend:** Brin is presented as part of a larger trend of high-profile leaders and professionals (like Bob Iger and Tom Brady) who return to their fields, driven by a desire for purpose, impact, and intellectual engagement rather than financial necessity.\n*   **Lesson for Everyone:** The core takeaway is that the old retirement model is becoming obsolete. The future likely involves longer, more flexible careers where people cycle between periods of intense work, breaks, and continued contribution based on their passions and skills. The article suggests this can lead to greater fulfillment and utilization of accumulated wisdom.\n\nIn essence, Brin's story is used to illustrate that for many, the ideal later career stage is not a full exit, but a purposeful and self-directed re-engagement with meaningful work.",

    "summary": "This article praises Dell's CES 2026 product briefing for its minimal focus on AI, a stark contrast to the tech industry's recent trend of heavily marketing AI features. The author expresses fatigue with the constant, often superficial, promotion of AI in product announcements.\n\nDuring the briefing, Dell executives discussed new laptops, desktops, and monitors with a \"consumer-first\" approach. They acknowledged that while their new devices contain AI-capable hardware (NPUs), they have shifted their marketing strategy. Dell's head of product stated that consumers are not buying PCs based on AI capabilities and that such marketing often confuses rather than helps them.\n\nThe article concludes that this shift is a welcome and refreshing change. It argues that until AI becomes a genuinely useful and tangible technology for everyday users, companies should follow Dell's lead and focus their messaging on practical consumer benefits rather than using AI as a buzzword.",
