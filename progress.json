    "url": "https://jonathanwhiting.com/writing/blog/games_in_c/",
    "summary": "In this article, game developer Jonathan Whiting explains his unconventional choice to write his solo game projects in \"vanilla\" C. He outlines his core requirements: a reliable, portable language with long-term stability to avoid constant platform re-writes. His preferences lean toward simplicity, strict typing for fewer bugs, fast compilation to maintain creative flow, and a non-OOP style that treats data and code separately.\n\nWhiting critiques common alternatives: C++ is too complex and slow to compile; C# and Java are verbose and enforce OOP; Go's garbage collection and limited game libraries are problematic; JavaScript is too loose; and creating a custom language is impractical. While he sees promise in Haxe for web development, it lacks C's maturity.\n\nUltimately, he chooses C because it is reliable, extremely fast to compile, highly portable, and has excellent long-term library and tooling support. He acknowledges its dangers but values its simplicity and control. Whiting clarifies he is not advocating for others to use C, noting his choice is based on his specific preferences and extensive experience with the language.",

    "summary": "This blog post from February 2026 is a lament for the traditional craft of software engineering in the face of advanced AI coding tools. The author, a senior developer, acknowledges the uncomfortable reality that these tools are effective and will soon outperform human programmers in raw code generation.\n\nHe addresses fellow mid-career professionals, warning that refusing to adopt AI will leave them at a severe disadvantage compared to junior colleagues who embrace it. For those with financial responsibilities, the pragmatic choice to use AI becomes a necessity for job security, even if it betrays the ideals of their younger selves.\n\nThe core of the article is an elegy for the lost artistry of programming. The author mourns the intimate, hands-on process of crafting code, the deep satisfaction of solving complex bugs, and the pride of personal creation—feelings he believes future AI-assisted generations will not comprehend.\n\nUltimately, he adopts a stance of resigned acceptance. While he does not celebrate this new era, he recognizes resistance as futile. The piece is an invitation to collectively grieve the inevitable passing of their craft, which will soon become a historical curiosity.",

    "url": "https://xorvoid.com/sectorc.html",
    "summary": "**SectorC** is a remarkably small C compiler written in x86-16 assembly, fitting entirely within a 512-byte boot sector. It supports a surprisingly capable subset of C, including global variables, functions, `if` and `while` statements, various operators, pointer dereferencing, and even inline machine code. To achieve this extreme size, the compiler uses several key innovations: it treats space-delimited \"mega-tokens\" as the fundamental lexical units, repurposes a simple `atoi()` function as a hash to identify keywords and variables, and employs a highly optimized, minimalist recursive-descent parser and code generator. An `asm` statement allows programs to embed raw machine code for I/O and hardware interaction, as the compiler itself provides no standard library. The project includes a small runtime and example programs (like a sine wave animation) that demonstrate its practicality. Ultimately, SectorC is a technical showcase in radical software minimization, proving that a usable C compiler can exist in a space traditionally reserved for a simple bootloader.",

On June 27, 2024, the facility conducted its final scheduled particle collisions, marking the end of a groundbreaking era in nuclear physics research.\n\nAs the first collider in the world capable of colliding heavy ions, RHIC's primary scientific achievement was creating and studying a unique state of matter called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). This hot, dense soup of fundamental particles replicates conditions that existed microseconds after the Big Bang. Key discoveries include confirming that the QGP behaves as a nearly \"perfect\" liquid with minimal viscosity and revealing how the spin of protons arises from the movements and interactions of their internal quarks and gluons.\n\nRHIC's legacy is defined by its unique versatility. It functioned as two distinct colliders in one: a heavy-ion collider to create the QGP and a polarized proton collider to probe proton spin. This dual capability, along with its innovative use of \"electron lenses\" for beam control, made it an unparalleled tool.\n\nWhile active collisions have ended, the accelerator complex will remain operational to support the ongoing Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) project. The EIC, a next-generation facility already under construction at Brookhaven, will use RHIC's existing infrastructure as its foundation. The conclusion of RHIC's run formally transitions the laboratory's focus toward completing this new facility, which is designed to probe the internal structure of protons and atomic nuclei in greater detail than ever before.",

After ruling out most unshifted characters due to shell semantics or filename conventions, he settled on the **comma**.\n\nPrefixing all personal commands with a comma (e.g., `,find`, `,mount`) makes them instantly distinguishable. This convention eliminates naming collisions and leverages shell tab-completion for easy browsing—typing `,` and then pressing tab lists all available custom commands.\n\nThe author notes the system has been robust and effective for about a decade, recommending it to others for keeping their personal command namespace clean, organized, and future-proof.",

    "summary": "This article argues that AI coding agents have fundamentally changed software development, making traditional frameworks obsolete. The author, drawing on extensive personal experience, states that since late 2025, these agents have eliminated the \"manual labour\" of typing code, allowing developers to focus on architecture and product design instead.\n\nThe core thesis is that frameworks were adopted to solve three problems: simplifying design (which the author calls \"intellectual surrender\"), automating boilerplate, and reducing labour costs by creating interchangeable \"framework developers.\" The author contends that coding agents now solve the automation problem more elegantly, rendering the other two framework benefits unnecessary and harmful.\n\nWith agents, developers can rapidly build custom, purpose-fit tools for each problem using foundational technologies like Bash and Makefiles. This returns \"true software engineering\"—solving actual product complexity rather than managing imposed framework complexity. The author urges developers to reject the lock-in and design constraints of major tech companies' frameworks and instead leverage AI agents to build uniquely tailored, owned solutions.",

Since agent performance varies significantly by task, language, and time, committing to one agent often leads to suboptimal results.\n\nThe authors propose a \"best-of-N\" workflow: they specify a task, run it in parallel across multiple agents, and have a human reviewer select the best output from the resulting solutions. This converts a prediction problem into an optimization problem.\n\nAnalyzing 211 real-world tasks, they found that while agents can be ranked, the rankings are noisy, with significant overlap in performance among top-tier models. The key insight is the \"selection advantage\": while the single top-rated agent won only 24% of tasks, a cohort of the top three agents won 51%, and the top seven won 91% of the time.\n\nThe conclusion is that you don't need to run every agent, but running a small cohort (3-7) from the top tier dramatically increases the chance of getting a high-quality solution. Since AI inference is relatively cheap compared to human engineering time, this parallel approach is a cost-effective way to improve code quality and reduce cleanup work.",

It explains that the 3270 system was innovative for its time, using a \"block mode\" data stream where users could fill out an entire screen of data locally before submitting it to the mainframe. This approach reduced I/O interrupts and improved efficiency, a concept similar to modern web forms.\n\nThe author details the system's technical advantages, such as its high-speed coaxial connections over long distances, and contrasts it with standard RS-232 terminals. While the physical hardware is now rare, the 3270 protocol lives on through emulation (tn3270) over TCP/IP, which remains essential for mainframe programming.\n\nA significant portion of the article describes the author's personal journey to acquire and restore a complete 3270 setup, including a 3179 colour display and a 3174 controller.

    "summary": "**Summary of \"Learning from context is harder than we thought\"**\n\nThe article from Tencent HY Research challenges the common assumption that large language models (LLMs) can easily learn and apply new information presented to them within a given context (in-context learning). The core finding is that this process is significantly more difficult and less reliable than previously believed.\n\nThe research demonstrates that LLMs often fail to correctly utilize key information—such as specific labels, rules, or facts—when it is provided only in the prompt's context window, rather than being part of the model's pre-trained weights. The models exhibit a strong bias towards relying on their prior parametric knowledge, sometimes ignoring or contradicting the explicit instructions and data supplied in-context.\n\nThis \"prior bias\" creates a major bottleneck for practical applications. It means that simply providing updated information, custom guidelines, or real-time data in a prompt does not guarantee the model will use it accurately. The study suggests this limitation is a fundamental property of current transformer-based architectures, not just a training data issue.\n\nThe conclusion is that achieving true, robust in-context learning requires moving beyond simply scaling model size. It points to the need for architectural innovations or novel training methodologies specifically designed to enhance a model's ability to override its ingrained knowledge with new, contextually-presented information. This insight has critical implications for deploying LLMs in dynamic, knowledge-intensive tasks where information changes rapidly.",

    "summary": "This article explains how geo joins (spatial joins using functions like `ST_Intersects`) are computationally expensive at scale, often leading to quadratic complexity. To solve this, it introduces a method using **H3's hierarchical hexagonal grid system** to dramatically speed up these joins.\n\nThe core technique is a query rewrite that replaces the direct spatial comparison with a two-step process:\n1.  **Fast Filter:** Represent each geography as a set of H3 cell IDs (an over-approximation to avoid false negatives). The join then becomes a fast, distributable **integer equi-join** on matching cell IDs.\n2.  **Exact Recheck:** Apply the original, expensive spatial predicate (e.g., `ST_Intersects`) only to the significantly reduced set of candidate pairs from the first step.\n\nThis approach shifts the workload from an expensive predicate on all pairs to a cheap hash join, followed by a cleanup. The **H3 resolution** acts as a tuning knob, balancing the number of false positives against the cost of generating and joining cells. Performance tests on a dataset of countries and cities showed a **400x speedup** at an optimal resolution, reducing query time from 459 seconds to just over 1 second. The method works with on-the-fly index computation, avoiding the need for materialized indexes and maintaining flexibility across views and subqueries.",
    "chinese_title": "利用H3索引加速地理连接",
    "chinese_summary": "本文阐述了地理连接（使用如`ST_Intersects`等函数进行的空间连接）在大规模计算中成本高昂，常导致二次复杂度的问题。为解决此问题，文章引入了一种利用**H3层级六边形网格系统**显著加速此类连接的方法。\n\n核心技巧是通过查询重写，将直接的空间比较替换为两步流程：\n1.  **快速过滤：** 将每个地理要素表示为一组H3单元ID（采用过近似以避免漏报）。连接随即转化为基于匹配单元ID的快速、可分布式执行的**整数等值连接**。\n2.  **精确复核：** 仅对第一步大幅缩减的候选对集合，应用原本计算代价高昂的空间谓词（如`ST_Intersects`）。\n\n该方法将计算负载从对所有数据对进行昂贵谓词评估，转移至廉价的哈希连接及后续清理。**H3分辨率**可作为调节旋钮，平衡误报数量与生成、连接单元的成本。在国家与城市数据集上的性能测试显示，在最优分辨率下实现了**400倍加速**，查询时间从459秒缩短至略超1秒。此方法支持动态索引计算，无需物化索引，并能保持跨视图和子查询的灵活性。"

    "title": "Show HN: Kappal – CLI to Run Docker Compose YML on Kubernetes for Local Dev",
    "url": "https://github.com/sandys/kappal",
    "summary": "Kappal is a CLI tool that allows developers to run their existing `docker-compose.yaml` files on a local Kubernetes cluster without requiring any Kubernetes knowledge. It uses a Docker Compose-like interface (`up`, `down`, `ps`, `logs`, `exec`) while automatically provisioning a K3s cluster in Docker.\n\nKey features include support for persistent volumes, service discovery, secrets, configs, scaling, networks, UDP ports, and dependency ordering for one-shot jobs (like database migrations). It uniquely supports AI agent integration, allowing tools like Claude Code to manage deployments autonomously.\n\nInstallation involves pulling a Docker image and creating an alias. After running `kappal --setup` in a project directory, developers can use familiar commands to manage their services on Kubernetes. The tool handles naming conflicts safely and can output machine-readable project state via `kappal inspect`.\n\nUnder the hood, Kappal uses `compose-go` to parse Compose files, transforms them into Kubernetes manifests, and deploys them to an embedded K3s instance. It passes 11 conformance tests covering core Compose specifications.",
    "chinese_title": "Show HN: Kappal – 在Kubernetes上运行Docker Compose YML的本地开发CLI工具",
    "chinese_summary": "Kappal是一款CLI工具，允许开发者在本地Kubernetes集群上运行现有的`docker-compose.yaml`文件，无需掌握Kubernetes知识。它采用类似Docker Compose的交互界面（`up`、`down`、`ps`、`logs`、`exec`），同时自动在Docker中配置K3s集群。\n\n核心功能包括支持持久化存储卷、服务发现、密钥管理、配置文件、服务扩缩容、网络配置、UDP端口支持，以及一次性任务（如数据库迁移）的依赖顺序管理。其独特之处在于支持AI智能体集成，允许像Claude Code这样的工具自主管理部署流程。\n\n安装方式为拉取Docker镜像并创建别名。在项目目录中运行`kappal --setup`后，开发者即可使用熟悉的命令管理Kubernetes上的服务。该工具能安全处理命名冲突，并通过`kappal inspect`输出机器可读的项目状态。\n\n底层实现上，Kappal使用`compose-go`解析Compose文件，将其转换为Kubernetes清单，并部署到嵌入式K3s实例中。该工具通过了涵盖Compose核心规范的11项一致性测试。"
